Print the 10 most recently posted books using the following api:

 http://www.paperbackswap.com/developers/

 - Clone/Fork a copy of this project and start from the **initial commit** branch
 - Look through the api documentation
 - Use the JSON version of the api 
 - There should be an endpoint for the 10 most recently posted books.
  - Parse through the JSON and print out the following to the console:
    - Book title
    - Book author
    - A Cover Image -> Use any one of the following values: SmallImage, MediumImage, LargeImage
    - Rating
    
 - Create your model to parse through the information

  **Hint** This one is a little trickier to solve so it would be wise of you to print out every step as you begin parsing. 

  **Hint** If you get the following error below... carefully review the url again
